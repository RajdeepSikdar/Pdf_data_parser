The PDF Data Parser is a streamlined tool designed to extract, clean, and structure textual data from PDF documents. Whether you're dealing with academic papers, cybersecurity reports, or business documents, this parser helps convert unstructured PDF content into usable chunks for downstream tasks like search, analysis, or AI-powered Q&A.

⚙️ Features
📥 Multi-PDF Support: Handles multiple PDFs simultaneously, each processed and indexed independently.

✂️ Smart Chunking: Splits large text bodies into overlapping chunks for better semantic retrieval.

🧠 Embedding-Ready Output: Prepares text chunks for use with embedding models like Sentence Transformers.

🗃️ FAISS Integration: Enables fast similarity search across parsed content.

🔐 Cybersecurity-Optimized: Ideal for parsing technical documents in domains like threat analysis, Zero Trust, and ransomware defense.

🧑‍💻 Use Cases
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems

AI-powered Q&A bots using LLMs like Gemini or GPT

Document summarization and search

Knowledge base construction from PDFs

🚀 How It Works
PDF Reading: Uses PyPDF2 to extract raw text from each page.

Text Chunking: Breaks text into manageable segments with overlap for context preservation.

Embedding Generation: Converts chunks into vector representations using transformer models.

Indexing: Stores embeddings in FAISS for fast similarity-based retrieval.
